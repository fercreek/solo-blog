Currently residing in Monterrey, Nuevo León, I am immersing myself in the world of cryptocurrencies, investment, and data analytics.

Here's a snapshot of my current activities:

- Developing [Studio Link](https://studiolink.online/) and [Vayla Dance](https://www.vayla.dance/) as side projects
- Engaging in crypto trading and investment
- Dancing bachata and salsa regularly

These are my primary focuses at the moment:

- Enhancing my dance skills
- Refining my daily habits
- Becoming a profitable trader
- Learning to delegate effectively and make informed decisions at work
- Increasing productivity to achieve more in less time

This page will be updated to reflect any changes in my activities or priorities. The last update was on December 27, 2025.

This page serves as a public declaration and a personal reminder, providing a balance to the goal-oriented nature of my [Impossible List](/impossible-list/). This concept was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now) and [Thomas Frank](https://collegeinfogeek.com/now/).
